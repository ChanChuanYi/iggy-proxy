**PROTOCOL SPEC**
Basic design of server is as follows:
	Establish socket to the port provided by user
	Listen for new connections
	Create a new process for each incoming connection
	  Read the request
	  if request is not GET or HEAD send error and listen for more connections
	  log request received and method
	  if host is not in request send error and listen for more connections
	  log request url and host
	  send request to server and wait for response
	  while server has stuff to consume, fill buffer and send to browser
	  if server buffer contained Connection:close end the process
	  else go back for more requests
	continue listening for more clients
