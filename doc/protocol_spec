**PROTOCOL SPEC**
Basic design of server is as follows:
	Establish socket to the port provided by user
	Listen for new connections
	Create a new process for each incoming connection
	  Read the request
	  if request is not GET or HEAD send error and listen for more connections
	  log request received and method
	  if host is not in request send error and listen for more connections
	  log request url and host
	  check if host is a forbidden host, if so, send 403 forbidden and exit
	  check if host is a secure connection host, if so build secure connection
		send data over secured connection and wait for response
		send response to the client
		close connection/ end process
	  send request to server and wait for response
	  while server has stuff to consume, fill buffer and send to browser
	  if server buffer contained Connection:close end the process
	  else go back for more requests
	continue listening for more clients
