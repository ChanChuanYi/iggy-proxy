**specifications**

In order to keep the design of the server/client relationship as simple
as possible,the following guidelines and assumptions were used:
-TCP will ensure messages from server will reach client and vise-versa

To that end, the program only relies on the 3 way handshake provided by TCP
and will not authenticate further. The client mearly needs to establish a 
connection and is immediately able to start parsing HTTP requests

It will furthermore assume that HTTP requests received are provided in standard
format. (i.e 1st line is ( [method] [uri] [http version]). Otherwise requests
are not forwarded to their destinations correctly.
